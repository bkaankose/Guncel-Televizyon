You can find Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8 projects in this repository.For technical information please follow TechnicalInformation.md file.Güncel Televizyon also has Web API working in the backend hosted in  Microsoft Azure.Unfortunately you can't find this project in tihs repository , but still can acces without even needing an authentication.

# What's missing in this repository ?

Windows Phone 8 client is still in development.I released first version of application last year and decided to make it better.I unpublished both Windows and Windows Phone app from Windows Store in order to publish the better ones :) I spent some time on Windows 8.1 app and released it , but still can't find the required time for Windows Phone 8 project.So I decided to open source it :)

Also as I mentioned in the section above , Web API project is missing on this repository.I need to make some changes in order to be able to make it generally available.So that needs to wait a while.
